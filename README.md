# Pickpocket Guardian plugin
This plugin is intended to be used to help prevent deaths while pickpocketing by preventing the "Pickpocket" action from being performed when at or below the specified HP threshold. This plugin also makes the Pyramid Plunder minigame safer by preventing the searching of urns and passing of speartraps when at or below 4 hitpoints and prevents the opening of the sarcophagus if the strength experience is undesired.

## Using the Pickpocket Guardian
The first step is to download the Pickpocket Guardian plugin from the Runelite Plugin Hub.

In your installed plugins, you should see "Pickpocket Guardian" appear in the Runelite sidebar. Click on the cog wheel to open up the settings.

Once in the settings, adjust the HP Threshold (box number 1) value to your desired amount. When AT or BELOW the set value, the plugin will prevent you from pickpocketing and display a message to eat food. It is recommended to set this value to whatever the NPC hits that you are pickpocketing. The default value is "3" for protection from master farmer and ardy knight deaths.

Under the Pyramid Plunder section, Safe Urn Openings & Speartraps is selected by default (box number 2). This setting will prevent the "Search" and "Check for Snakes" options on urns and the "Pass" option on speartraps when at or below 4 hitpoints, or their max hit possible. Lastly, the Prevent Sarcophagus Opening option (box number 3) can be toggled to prevent unwanted strength experience in Pyramid Plunder.
